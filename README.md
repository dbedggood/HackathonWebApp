# Hackathon Web App

An event management web application.

What sets this event management application apart from the rest is that this web app allows hosts to get a good idea of attendee attendance.

The host should be able to see:

* A list of attendees
* Which attendees are present
* Which attendees are on the way
* Which attendees are not coming

The host is able to view this information because when an attendee uses the web app, their current location information is compared with the event location using an external maps API. Whether or not they are present, or their ETA is then sent to the host and updates the host's list.

This improves interactions in local communities because... // TODO
